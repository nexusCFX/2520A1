A JFlex+Cup implementation for the C- language, based on the parser for the Tiny programming language written by Dr. Fei Song.

To build all the code required to parse and produce an abstract syntax tree and generate TM assembly code, type "make" in the current directory.

To run the program using a source code file like "fac.cm" type:

    ./compiler fac.cm [-a] [-s] [-c]

To output the AST use the following flag: -a
To display the table use the following flag: -s
To display the generated assembly code use the following flag: -c
Semantic errors are sent to stderr and may conflict with symbol table display on stdout if not redirected.

To rebuild the project, type "make clean" and then "make" again.
