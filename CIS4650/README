A JFlex+Cup implementation for the C- language, based on the parser for the Tiny programming language written by Dr. Fei Song.

To build all the code required to parse and produce an abstract syntax tree, type "make" in the current directory.

To display the AST of a source code file like "fac.cm" type:

    java -cp java-cup-11b-runtime.jar:. Main fac.cm

To rebuild the project, type "make clean" and then "make" again.

All class files for the abstract syntax tree are in the folder called absyn, except for the tree visitor implementation file which is included along with the Java Main class and Scanner class in the current directory.
